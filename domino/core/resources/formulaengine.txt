1) One design goal of foconis was that the core of the formula engine has no dependency to notes 
(and also no dependency to org.openntf.domino) so that you can easily use it in your own java
application 

=> That's why we moved it to a own project "org.openntf.formula".
This runs already in a pure java enviroment and can also be used in LS2J calls (which helps
porting some application step by step to java/xpages)

2) The formula engine does not (and cannot, due reason 1) work on a "lotus.domino.Document" as 
contxtDocument.
Instead a dataMap is used. Formulas like 'FIELD "myField" := "myValue"' or '@getField("otherValue")' are 
translated to 'dataMap.put("myField","myValue")' or 'dataMap.get("otherValue")'.
Also Functions like @DocFields (=dataMap.keySet) and @Unavailable (=dataMap.remove) will work properly.

3) org.openntf.Domino implements also the Map interface. So you can use the formulas also on documents :)

4) We had one problem with DateTimes. We cannot use the org.openntf.domino.impl.DateTime and the interface
org.openntf.domino.DateTime is also not available.
So we introduced the "org.openntf.formula.DateTime" interface that implements a subset of the method from the 
org.openntf.domino.DateTime interface.

====
IMPORTANT CHANGE: the "org.openntf.domino.DateTime" has to implement the "org.openntf.formula.DateTime" interface.
This makes it easy to use the domino-DateTimes in the formula. Otherwise I will have to wrap them.
====

5) To use Date functions outside domino (in pure java, see 1) we made a Implementation of "org.openntf.formula.DateTime" in
org.openntf.formula.impl.DateTimeImpl. This uses mainly the com.ibm.icu.Calendar. 

As I didn't want to make a further linked folder to the icu stuff in the formula project, I moved  the icu stuff to 
a own project. I have to say I did not yet understand completely, why the icu code is in the org.openntf.domino project.
(I think it is primary needed if we run outside Xpage/notes, but then I think it is better to build a special jar)


----------------------------------------------
6) Changes in the "org.openntf.domino" project:
- icu4j moved to own plugin
- org.openntf.domino is now also a plugin. It gets the (correct) icu code by "Require-Bundle: com.ibm.icu"
  in the MANIFEST.MF file
- source code is syncronized with OSGI-OPT folder. This gives javadoc and correct parameter names in DDE
- formula-core moved to own plugin.
- domino specific formula extensions are loaded with the Java-SPI (there are some issues as this does not 
  yet work properly in OSGI environment: See http://blog.osgi.org/2013/02/javautilserviceloader-in-osgi.html)
- org.openntf.formula.DateTime is dominoFriendly now
- Session already uses the new formula engine (TODO: should be switchable)

- I know there is (actually) no automatic build process that builds a JAR that can be used in a NotesAgent.
- Still TODO: Check functions that uses resources in the classes (e.g. reading version infos from Manifest.MF)

----------------------------------------------
7) Changes in the "org.openntf.domino.plugin" project:
- removed the linked source folder "domsrc" of the org.openntf.domino project, it is referenced now by 
  a entry in MANIFEST.MF => "Require-Bundle: org.openntf.domino" 
- the plugin now contains ONLY the Activator.class. Maybe it is no longer needed (I think this was a "wrapper" for
  the POJO-org.openntf.domino stuff
  
----------------------------------------------
7) Changes in the "org.openntf.domino.xsp" project:
- Added an "OpenntfDominoDocument extends DominoDocument" that can hook into the <xp:dominoDocument> to overwrite
  methods in DominoDocument (fixing bugs or whatever you want to do there) 
- OpenntfDominoDocument implements the Map interface, so that it can be used as context-document for the formula engine
- more xpage-specific formula extensions are loaded with the Java-SPI (Here I also had some issues that SPI does not
  work correctly in OSGI-environment. Maybe we find a better way. OSGI service registry or something like this)

/**
 * Represents a date and time.
 * <h3>Notable enhancements and changes</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Use {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.DateTime#isAfter(DateTime)} and {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.DateTime#isBefore(DateTime)} to
 * determine whether this <code>DateTime</code> is before or after another <code>DateTime</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * <h3>Creation</h3>
 * <p>
 * To create a new <code>DateTime</code> object, use {@link Session#createDateTime(Date)}.
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * <p>
 * After creating a <code>DateTime</code> object with {@link Session#createDateTime(Date)}, you can reset the date and time with
 * {@link #setLocalTime(java.util.Calendar)} and {@link #setLocalDate(int, int, int)}. The <code>createDateTime</code> method takes a
 * <code>String</code>, <code>java.util.Date</code>, or <code>java.util.Calendar</code> parameter. One form of {@link #setLocalTime(String)}
 * takes a <code>String</code> parameter, another form takes a <code>java.util.Date parameter</code>, and a third form takes a
 * <code>java.util.Calendar</code> parameter. Other forms of {@link #setLocalTime(int, int, int, int) setLocalTime} and
 * {@link #setLocalDate(int, int, int) setLocalDate} take multiple int parameters.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The String form of the date parameter is a date, followed by a space, followed by a time. You can specify a date without a time, and a
 * time without a date, but the time zone will not be set (see "Time zones" below).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following applies when setting a date and time from a <code>String</code> value:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The date and time components are interpreted according to the regional settings of the operating system if possible. For example, if
 * the regional setting for dates is M/d/yy, then "3/4/05" means 4 March 2005.</li>
 * <li>If the date or time cannot be interpreted using the regional setting, alternate settings are tried until one works. For example, if
 * the regional setting for dates is M/d/yy, then "13/4/05" means 13 April 2005 (using d/M/yy as the alternate setting) and "13/33/05" means
 * 13 May 2033 (using d/yy/M as the alternate setting).</li>
 * <li>If the date or time cannot be interpreted using any setting, the following exception is thrown: NOTES_ERR_INVALID_DATE (4045).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The <code>java.util.Calendar</code> class can be used to avoid dependencies on regional settings. For example, you can use
 * <code>getInstance</code> and one of the set methods to create the parameter for {@link Session#createDateTime(java.util.Calendar)}.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Time zones</h3>
 * <p>
 * When you create a new <code>DateTime</code> object, the time zone setting in Domino determines the {@link #getTimeZone() TimeZone}
 * property. For example, if the code runs on a computer where the Domino time zone is set to Eastern Standard Time, the
 * {@link #getTimeZone() TimeZone} property of any new <code>DateTime</code> object is automatically set to 5. The time zone setting also
 * affects the {@link #getGMTTime() GMTTime} property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you create a date without a time component or without a date component, the time zone is invalid and the {@link #getTimeZone()
 * TimeZone} property returns 0. In this case, both {@link #getLocalTime()} and {@link #getGMTTime()} return the same time value without a
 * time zone appended. If you apply {@link #convertToZone(int, boolean)}, the time zone remains invalid and {@link #getTimeZone() TimeZone}
 * remains 0; no error occurs.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Today, Tomorrow, and Yesterday</h3>
 * <p>
 * When you create a new <code>DateTime</code> object using an expression such as "Today," "Tommorow," or "Yesterday," the value of the date
 * is determined using the current date setting in Domino. These expressions have no effect on the time component of a <code>DateTime</code>
 * object. To set a <code>DateTime</code> to the current date and time, specify the time after "Today" or "Yesterday" (for example, "Today
 * 12:00:00 AM") or use {@link #setNow()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Access</h3>
 * <p>
 * To access a date-time value stored in an item in a Domino document, use {@link Item#getDateTimeValue()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can get the operating system date and time separators, and time zone settings through the {@link International} class.
 * </p>

 * The bitmap data is divided into segments to optimize data storage within Domino. It is recommended that each segment be no larger than
 * 10k bytes. For best display speed, the segments sould be as large as possible, up to the practical 10k limit. A scanline must be
 * contained within a single segment, and cannot be divided between two segments. A bitmap must contain at least one segment, but may have
 * many segments. (editods.h)

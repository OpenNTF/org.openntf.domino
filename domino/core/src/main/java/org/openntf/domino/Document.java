/**
 * Document in a Notes application. It contains practical enhancements for daily use, check the {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.Document}
 * interface in the org.openntf.domino.ext package for documentation and examples.
 *
 * <h3>Notable enhancements</h3>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Use {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.Document#appendItemValue(String, Object, boolean)} to add a value to an item only if the value
 * doesn't exist in the item already</li>
 * <li>Use {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.Document#toJson(boolean)} to retrieve a JSON representation of the document</li>
 * <li>Use {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.Document#getItemValue(String, Class)} to retrieve an item's value casted directly to a specific
 * object type</li>
 * <li>Use {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.Document#getItemValues(String, Class)} to retrieve multivalue item as a List of specific object
 * types</li>
 * <li>Use {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.Document#containsValue(Object, String[])} to check if document contains a value in one of the
 * specified items</li>
 * <li>Use {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.Document#getItemTable(CharSequence...)} and
 * {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.Document#getItemTablePivot(CharSequence...)} to conveniently work with multiple items which logically form
 * a table.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h3>Creation</h3>
 * <p>
 * To create a new Document object, use {@link Database#createDocument()}.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Access</h3>
 * <p>
 * To access existing documents:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>To get all the documents in a database, use {@link Database#getAllDocuments()}.</li>
 * <li>To get a document based on its position in a view, use a {@link View} object.</li>
 * <li>To get a document based on its position in a response hierarchy, use a {@link View} object. To get all documents that are responses
 * to a particular document, use {@link Document#getResponses()}. To get a response document's parent document, use
 * {@link Document#getParentDocumentUNID()} followed by {@link Database#getDocumentByUNID(String)}.</li>
 * <li>To get all the documents that match a full-text search query, use {@link Database#FTSearch(String)} or
 * {@link View#FTSearch(String)}.</li>
 * <li>To get all the documents in a database that meet search criteria, where the criteria are defined using the formula language, use
 * {@link Database#search(String)}.</li>
 * <li>To get documents in a database not yet processed by the current agent, use {@link AgentContext#getUnprocessedDocuments()},
 * {@link AgentContext#unprocessedFTSearch(String, int)}, and
 * {@link AgentContext#unprocessedSearch(String, lotus.domino.DateTime, int)}.</li>
 * <li>To get a document based on its note ID or UNID, use {@link Database#getDocumentByID(int)} or
 * {@link Database#getDocumentByUNID(String)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Once you have a view, you can navigate to a specific document using methods in the {@link View} class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once you have a collection of documents, you can navigate to a specific document using methods in the {@link DocumentCollection} class.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Saving changes</h3>
 * <p>
 * After you create, modify, or delete a document, you must save the changes by calling the {@link #save()} method. If you don't call
 * <code>save</code> before the program finishes, all of your changes to a <code>Document</code> are lost.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you create and save a new document without adding any items to it, the document is saved with one item "$UpdatedBy." This item
 * contains the name of the creator of the document.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Encryption</h3>
 * <p>
 * A program attempts to decrypt an encrypted document the first time the program accesses one of the <code>Document</code> properties or
 * methods. If decryption fails, an exception is thrown.
 * </p>

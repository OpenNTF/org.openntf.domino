/**
 * A view in a Notes application.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Notable enhancements and changes</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>When returned by {@link org.openntf.domino.Database#getView(String)}, the {@link #isAutoUpdate() autoUpdate} property is set to false
 * when Khan mode is enabled.</li>
 * <li>Use {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.View#checkUnique(Object, Document)} to check if there is only one document in the view with the
 * given key</li>
 * <li>Use {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.View#containsDocument(Document)} and {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.View#containsEntry(ViewEntry)}
 * to check if a document or view entry are displayed in view.</li>
 * <li>Use {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.View#getFirstDocumentByKey(Object, boolean)} instead of
 * {@link org.openntf.domino.View#getDocumentByKey(Object, boolean)}</li>
 * <li>Check if the view contains formulas based on current time using {@link org.openntf.domino.ext.View#isTimeSensitive()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * See the implementation class {@link org.openntf.domino.impl.View} for details on how the {@link java.util.Map} interface is implemented.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Access</h3>
 * <p>
 * You access a view or folder through the {@link Database} object that contains it. There are two ways:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>To access a view or folder when you know its name or alias, use {@link Database#getView(String)}.</li>
 * <li>To access all the views and folders in a database, use {@link Database#getViews()}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Returned is a <code>View</code> object or a vector of <code>View</code> objects that represent accessible views and/or folders in the
 * database. These <code>View</code> objects may be public views or folders or private views or folders stored in the database that are
 * owned by the effective id running the agent. Personal views and folders stored in the desktop cannot be accessed by programs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To access a view or folder when you have a view entry, use getParent in ViewEntry.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * <p>
 * A View object provides access to {@link ViewEntry}, {@link ViewEntryCollection}, and {@link ViewNavigator} objects:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A {@link ViewEntry} object represents a row in the view and can be a document, category, or total. A document entry provides a handle
 * to the associated {@link Document} object.</li>
 * <li>A {@link ViewEntryCollection} object provides access to selected or all document {@link ViewEntry} objects. (Excluded are category
 * and total <code>ViewEntry</code> objects.)</li>
 * <li>A {@link ViewNavigator} object provides methods for navigating through selected or all {@link ViewEntry} and {@link Document}
 * objects.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A <code>View</code> object provides access to {@link ViewColumn} objects, which contain information on each column in the view.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you create a <code>View</code> object then change a document so that it affects the underlying view, navigation with the
 * <code>View</code> object may produce incorrect results.You must refresh the <code>View</code> object or create a new one. Document
 * changes that affect views include additions, deletions, and changes to fields used by selection formulas. See {@link #refresh()} for
 * further information.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Automatic updates: avoid</h3>
 * <p>
 * Avoid automatically updating the view by explicitly setting {@link #isAutoUpdate()} to false especially if the view is a base for
 * navigators or entry collections. Automatic updates degrade performance and may invalidate entries in child objects ("Entry not found in
 * index"). You can update the view as needed with refresh.
 * </p>

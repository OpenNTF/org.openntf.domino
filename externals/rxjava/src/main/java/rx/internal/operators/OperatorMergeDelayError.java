/**
 * This behaves like {@link OperatorMerge} except that if any of the merged Observables notify of
 * an error via {@code onError}, {@code mergeDelayError} will refrain from propagating that error
 * notification until all of the merged Observables have finished emitting items.
 * <p>
 * <img width="640" src="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/wiki/images/rx-operators/mergeDelayError.png" alt="">
 * <p>
 * Even if multiple merged Observables send {@code onError} notifications, {@code mergeDelayError} will
 * only invoke the {@code onError} method of its Observers once.
 * <p>
 * This operation allows an Observer to receive all successfully emitted items from all of the
 * source Observables without being interrupted by an error notification from one of them.
 * <p>
 * <em>Note:</em> If this is used on an Observable that never completes, it will never call {@code onError} and will effectively swallow errors.

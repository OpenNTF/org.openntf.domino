 * This is useful with an Observable that you want to cache responses when you can't control the
 * subscribe/unsubscribe behavior of all the Observers.
 * <p>
 * <em>Note:</em> You sacrifice the ability to unsubscribe from the origin when you use this operator, so be
 * careful not to use this operator on Observables that emit infinite or very large numbers of
 * items, as this will use up memory.

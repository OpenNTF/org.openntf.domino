 * <b>Note on thread-safety and performance:</b>
 * <p>
 * A single implementation of this class will be used globally so methods on this class will be invoked

 * <p>
 * Methods are also invoked synchronously and will add to execution time of the observable so all behavior
 * should be fast. If anything time-consuming is to be done it should be spawned asynchronously onto separate
 * worker threads.
